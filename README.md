Here is the repository that holds an app ["Beats of the ERA"](https://hydrogo.github.io/beats-of-the-era/).

This project has been done for the "Hack-Out" challenge on the [#OpenDataHack2018](https://events.ecmwf.int/event/79/) organized by [ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int/).

The main idea of the presented project is to enrich an [AI-inspired music generation](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/) with the latest [ERA5](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/archive-datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5) climate reanalysis data.

You can find the [Google Collab](https://colab.research.google.com) notebook for beats generation for your own location [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tdjEx9Fwm_yYx_2sQ5vf5i-IYMkiwMFT/view?usp=sharing).

Project presentation and a short description are also available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRwnDfz2AkmdUD-ggfg-_a30jGPAE4FrpyisKPAW6fUOWkVevG2sLDU9A-u0UrgbaAGu2zti2hD1X0u/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000).

We have also created the [SoundCloud playlist](https://soundcloud.com/georgy-ayzel/sets/beats-of-the-era) with the presented beats.

Feel free to contact us for any details using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/hydrogo/beats-of-the-era/issues).
